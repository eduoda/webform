webform
=======

The Webform module for DrupalGap.

Installation
============

1. Download and enable the 7.x-3.x version of the Webform Service module:

https://www.drupal.org/project/webform_service

2. In Drupal, go to admin/structure/services/list/drupalgap/resources and enable
   your desired service resources under "webform_submission". We recommend
   enabling at least the "create", "retrieve" and "index" resources. Visit the
   admin/people/permissions page in Drupal, and review the permissions you have
   set for Webform module. That will give you a better idea of what service
   resources you should consider enabling.

3. After enabling the service resources, it's a good idea to the clear all the
   caches in Drupal.
